## Introduction
Document classification is a traditional problem in text mining and Natural Language Processing. Its applications are of broad range and one of them is management of library or any searching service on scholarly paper. It is believed that in the near future library work will be impacted significantly by artificial intelligence and machine learning systems (Griffey, 2019). The goal of our project is to design and compare machine learning systems that assign topics to research papers given their abstracts.
